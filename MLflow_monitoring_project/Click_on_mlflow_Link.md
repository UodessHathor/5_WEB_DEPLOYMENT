## Link of the MLflow Experiments 🖥️

GetAround team also asked us **build a machine learning model** which can **predict rental prices** for a day. 
For that reason, before launching the API, we tested a bunch of Machine Learning Models and tracked all the experiments thanks to MLflow tool.
Check the *accuracy* and all *sklearn metrics* inside tge **GETAROUND-PROJECT-pricing-deployment** experiment. ✅
