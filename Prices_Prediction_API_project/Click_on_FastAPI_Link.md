## Link of the API  🖥️

As you understood, GetAround team asked us **build a machine learning model** which can **predict rental prices** for a day. 
Consequently, after testing and monitoring models thanks to MLflow too, I **deployed an API thanks to FastAPI**, where you can *enter car criterias* to **retrive data and obtain a predictive rental price** per day. 
The endpoint where you can do those predictions is the **/predict endpoint** at the end of the doc ✅
